# CS425-Distributed-Systems
My MP solutions for CS425 (2015 Fall) with help from Keda Ruan. This solution set is only for reference.


1. These MP's are designed to build a final whole system (MP4). But I have also included all the four components because either they have to be modified to fit into the final one (e.g., MP2) or they are optinal for the final one (e.g., MP3).
2. Like most of the course projects, this is just a toy system, but educational.
3. It may help you to get a feeling of what is basically necessary to complete your MP's, in other words, a sketch. Do not copy the code.
